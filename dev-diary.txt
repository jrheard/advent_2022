i have an interview in a few days and have to write python for the coding exercise
i've been learning typescript lately so i want to refresh my python muscle memory
starting up another aoc year to focus on python

for at least the first day, i'm gonna do my work in coderpad and copy-paste it over when i'm done
coderpad's vim support isn't 100% so i'm gonna have to use my mouse and stuff
